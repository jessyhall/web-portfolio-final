        This audio is a piece I created for a soundscape narrative assignment, where I had to create an audio file that told some sort of story. For this soundscape I wanted to emulate the sounds of going on a walk through Oakland and Schenley Park. Throughout the past year or so, I would go on long walks through Schenley to clear my mind and get fresh air, which was extremely essential for me during the height of the pandemic when we could barely even go get coffee. These walks were somewhat of an escape for me; it would give me an hour or so to just not think about anything that was going on or stressing me out, I just walked through nature and relaxed. This is the feeling I want to give to the listeners: a relaxing escape from reality. I recorded an audio of myself closing and locking my front door, and then with downloaded sounds I put together walking on pavement, which would be from my house to the park, walking through a forest sound, which represents going through the Park itself, then back to pavement until the end, where I'd be returning to my house. I also included sounds of birds chirping and creeks flowing, to add to the effect of being out in nature. On all tracks except the first one that is heard, which is the one i recorded myself, I used the fade in and fade out effects at the beginning and end, respectively, so that when it went from one track to another, everything flowed together nicely and didn't sound super choppy.

    <h2> Visual Argument Assignment </h2>

        <p>
          This image was created for a visual argument assignment, in which I had to create an image using rhetorical analysis to get a message across. The message I wanted to get across was that driving while high is still a DUI, as when I was in high school people seemed to think it was fine because they weren't drunk. In terms of my design choices, I used green text for the word high to imply that I'm referring to marijuana, and red text for DUI to show that it's bad and not something you want. I also used a photo of a red car so it would pop out, as the human eye is naturally drawn to the color red. Using photoshop, I added a blur feature to the car to show that it's moving, and added smoke coming out of the driver side window, which I also applied a blur effect to, to further show I'm referring to weed use while driving. I left the background black so it was plain and didn't take away from the message I'm trying to get across. I selected a car out of a photo that I found on a free image website and pasted it onto the main document with the black background. I had considered having the car be on a road, but when I tried that I felt the image was too noisy with the text, and it would distract from the message that I'm trying to get across. Leaving the background as a lot of negative space makes sure the viewer is only seeing the important parts of the image. The audience for this argument is young people; high school or college aged. I used the chalkboard font so it was easy on the eyes but still would give an authoritative effect, as people this age are used to seeing teachers write on chalkboards.
