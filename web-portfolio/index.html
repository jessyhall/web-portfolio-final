  <h2> Photography </h2>
    <p> Throughout my life, I have always loved photography. I took a photography class all four years of high school and participated in my school's art show every spring during that time. It was a way for me to document things I loved and experiment with arts outside of dance. </p>

  <h2> Other Digtial Media </h2>
  <p> These are works I completed for my Composing Digital Media class at Pitt. I took this class to fulfill my arts general education requirement, and there were 3 major projects. The first two can be seen by following the link to the page, and they are a visual argument and a soundscape narrative. More information on these projects can be seen on the page. The final project for this class was actually building this website! </p>
