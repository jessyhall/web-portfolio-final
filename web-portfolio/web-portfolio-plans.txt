my plan for this site is to display my photography work from over the past several years, as well as include a tab for works completed in this class. I'll have two types of photography--nature and other, to separate the separate types of photography i like to do, and i've included little blurbs about each photo. I also included a second html page for my composing digital media works, and included parts of my reflection under both the soundscape and the visual argument. for the photography page i did learn how to make it into two columns instead of 3, and i considered using that for the CDM page, but i didn't like how it looked with the paragraphs ending unevenly so i left that one as just one column and the viewer would have to scroll to see that. on the home page i have two columns describing each of the secondary html pages, and then i included a photo of myself and a little bio about myself, and there are navigation tabs at the top of each page.
